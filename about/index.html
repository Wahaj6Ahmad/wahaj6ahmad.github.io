    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>
      I grew up in a family of tinkerers who believed they could fix anything.
      There’s a running joke that when we call a technician, they get paid to hold the torch while we do the work.
      When I was eleven, I replaced the blown battery in my sister’s toy laptop, and it flipped a switch for me.
      I wanted to understand how things work, and I wanted to build them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Today, I’m a robotics and mechatronics systems engineer with a background in interaction technology.
      I work at the intersection of hardware, software, and people.
      I’ve done embedded and electromechanical integration, field installation and troubleshooting, and research in human–robot interaction.
      I like making systems stable, testable, and usable.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m looking for teams where I can contribute quickly, keep learning, and build products that matter.
      I’m interested in AI too, but only when it adds real value, not as a marketing checkbox.
    </p>

    <p class="muted">
      Outside work, I like chess, the gym, squash, games, and DIY projects.
